<h1 style="color:crimson;text-align: center; ">Every Vote Counts!</h1>
<p style="font-size: 150%;"><b>By Friday, October 23, more than 50 million Americans had already cast their ballots in the 2020 election. Those ballots represent 36.5% of all the votes cast in the 2016 presidential election, and election day (in case it’s not marked in RED on your calendar) is November 3. Many of these voters were women, casting their ballots for women up and down the ticket, and many other women plan to join them in the coming days. In fact, the Brookings Institute calls 2020 “The Year of the Woman Voter” and writes that this year’s election is being driven by the increasingly overwhelming determination of a significant number of women from every demographic.<br>Women do deserve the same rights. We are the supermajority, and on November 3 we have the opportunity to make our voices heard and choose representation that looks like us – female! We can elect women from local offices, like the school board to the second highest office in the land. This is our chance to vote for women like us who know what it’s like to juggle the demands of a career with the needs of a family, women who know that you deserve equal pay, who value affordable healthcare, childcare and workplace protections, and women who are empowered and who can help you make your voice heard.</b></p>
<h1 style="color:crimson;text-align: center; ">Gender Bias a crisis to India</h1>
<p style="font-size: 150%;"><b>Does that sound weird? Yes that’s right, it’s because this situation still prevails in our country. Every day we read news of some father deliberately denying treatments or food to his daughter and making the killing look a ‘natural death’. If the father is more aggressive he goes to the extent of completing the act by brutally killing the girl with his own hands. Parents abandon their girl child on the streets disowning them completely while fight with the Hospital authorities for the custody of a boy child handed to them by mistake. Such atrocious behaviour is unthinkable and cruel.<br>
<br>
There are numerous illegal maternity clinics operating in remote places of our country where the doctor ‘helps’ the parents to determine the sex of the foetus and aborts the female ones if the parents desire. Everyone knows this is a crime and morally wrong too yet this is being practiced even in the cities in a hushed up environment. Girls are looked upon as an unwanted burden, a thankless responsibility as unlike the sons who would carry on the family’s name. A great amount of money would be required to be arranged to get them married.</b></p>
